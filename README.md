# According to JavaScript
A series of articles describing non-JavaScript technical specs from the perspective of a JavaScript developer.

## Why write this series?
Couple of reasons:
- Exercise my rusty writing skills
- Learn different technical stuff and programming languages

I can do both at the same time with this writing concept!

## Cool TODOs
Here are some stuff I find cool to write about (in this series):
- Find a complex algorithm and try to explain it using JavaScript pseudo-code
- Get a programming language tutorial and add pointers that would be helpful for a JavaScript dev
